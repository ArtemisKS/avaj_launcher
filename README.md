# About Avaj-Launcher

Frankfurt airport recently discovered that due to frequent weather changes they have a

bottleneck on some of the landing tracks. In order to find a solution, they first need to

know which scenarios create the worst bottlenecks. So they decided to use a simulator

where they configure and analyze multiple scenarios and hope that this will highlight

them were the real problem is.

# Forewords

``M. Gustave:`` You see, there are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric
slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity. Indeed that's what we provide in our own modest,
humble, insignificant... oh, fuck it.

``M. Gustave:`` [to Mme. Celine's corpse] You're looking so well, darling, you really are...
they've done a marvelous job. I don't know what sort of cream they've put on you down at the morgue,
but... I want some.

``Henckels:`` By order of the commissioner of police, Zubrowka Province, I hereby place you under
arrest for the murder of Madame Celine Villenueve Desgoffe-und-Taxis.<br />
M. Gustave: I knew there was something fishy. We never got the cause of death. She's been murdered,
and you think I did it.<br />
[runs away]

``Dmitri:`` If I learn you ever once laid a finger on my mother's body, living or dead, I swear to
God, I'll cut your throat! You hear me?<br />
``M. Gustave:`` I thought I was supposed to be a fucking faggot.<br />
``Dmitri:`` You are, but you're bisexual.<br />

``Zero:`` What happened?<br />
``M. Gustave:`` What happened, my dear Zero, is I beat the living shit out of a sniveling little runt
called Pinky Bandinski, who had the gall to question my virility. Because, if there's one thing we've
learned from penny dreadfuls, it's that when you find yourself in a place like this, you must never
be a candy ass; you've got to prove yourself from day one. You've got to win their respect. You should
take a long look at HIS ugly mug this morning.<br />
[Takes a sip of water and laughs]<br />
``M. Gustave:`` He's actually become a dear friend.

``Deputy Kovacs:`` Did he just throw my cat out of the window?

``Zero:`` Do you have an alibi?<br />
``M. Gustave:`` Of course, but she's married to the Duke of Westphalia. I can't allow her name to get
mixed up in all this monkey business.<br />
``Zero:`` Monsieur Gustave, your life may be at stake.<br />
``M. Gustave:`` I know! The bitch legged it! She's already on board the Queen Nasstasja, halfway to Dutch
Tanganyika.
